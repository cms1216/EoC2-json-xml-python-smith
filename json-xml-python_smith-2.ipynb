But, I really expected for them to be printed with the date. I am not really sure why that data point didn't print dispite the fact that it was defined in the for loop to be a part of the data. To me, the way this code works is that the code imports the xml.etree as variable ET and defines the tree variable as the desired xml file and the root as tree.getroot(). The the code runs a for loop that parses the data inside the xml and defines what each point of data is in relation to title and date. Finally, the code prints the information extracted from the xml in a list.</blockquote>"
